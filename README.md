# Lenvideo-Go
Lenvideo-Go is a light and functional tool for working with audio, video and images.
Presented in two versions: complete and specialized. The second is made to order and is needed only to find the total duration of video files in a folder.
Thanks for using.

Note. If the project doesn't work, install libraries "Colorama" and "Moviepy".
